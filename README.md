# CHURN RATE PREDICTION - ANN

The project involves developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or subscribers. Accurately predicting churn helps businesses implement strategies to retain customers, thereby increasing profitability.
